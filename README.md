# ServiceScript

## Why?
Highly opinionated, zero dependency Groovy script powered fast http service prototyping without creating a project.
This is not designed with REST in mind.

## Prerequisites
* Java
* Groovy

## How to use it?
Just download [ServiceScript.groovy](./ServiceScript.groovy) file to you local machine.
You can now import that file to any other Groovy script you want using classic `import` statement.

```groovy
import static ServiceScript.*
```
## Example
See [CarsService.groovy](./CarsService.groovy).
